# PLANT HUB

### Live Link:

    https://plant-hub.herokuapp.com/

### Description:

    PlantHub is an app that allows you to create an account and log in. Once you are logged in you can view the plants, add plants, edit plants, and delete plants. To edit a plant you must have the scientific name, basic care instructions, and an image of the plant.

## Languages:

    Angular, jQuery, Spectre(CSS framework)

### Things I Taught Myself:

    - How to upload and use custom fonts
    - Spectre


### Struggles:

    I used Spectre for my modal styling and had to use jQuery with it. One of the biggest struggles I had was that I tried to use jQuery within an ng-repeat and realized that it wasn't going to work because of the two seperate JS frameworks.

    One thing I really didn't like about Spectre is that it effected the styling of my entire app. The alpha channel wouldn't work at all and everything ended up being just a solid color.

### Upgrades:

    I would make it so that each user views only their plants.
    I would make a discussion board for all of the members.
    I would make a watering schedule calendar.
    Be able to set your account to private.
